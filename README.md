Data Visualization Blog

<https://eric-seltzer.github.io/DataVizBlog/>
This blog is a project for my Data Visualization class. The data was either collected from the GitHub repository Tidy Tuesday, or scraped and downloaded from various websites. The goal of this project is to provide meaningful plots with meaningful interpretations. These should be clean, visually pleasing, and easy for both statistics savvy people, and non statistics people to understand. My goal was to combine things I'm passionate about such as Financial Metrics and sports, with the improvement of my analytical skills and visualization skills. I hope you enjoy!
