This blog was created for my Data Visualization class. My goal is to create interpretable visualizations that are easy for non statistics people to understand, as well as having hints to further interpretations if you look further. I wanted to combine this with things I am passionate about. This is why there is a blog post about stock prices, soccer, and basketball. I hope to expand on these subjects well also improving the visualizatoin skills and my analytical skills. I hope you enjoy!
